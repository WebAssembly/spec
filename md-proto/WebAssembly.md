Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WebAssembly, or "wasm" for short, is a general-purpose virtual [ISA] designed to
be a compilation target for a wide variety of programming languages. Much of its
distinct personality derives from its security, code compression, and decoding
optimization features.

The unit of WebAssembly code is the *module*. Modules primarily consist of a
collection of sections. There are sections describing a WebAssembly's
interactions with other modules ([imports] and [exports]), sections declaring
[data](#data-section) and other implements used by the module, and sections
defining [*functions*]. For more information, see the [Module section].

WebAssembly modules can be encoded either in [binary format] for size and
decoding efficiency or in [text format] for readability, and can be translated
from either format to the other.

WebAssembly code must be validated before it can be instantiated and executed.
WebAssembly is designed to allow validation to be performed in a single linear
pass through a WebAssembly module. In particular, control flow within each
function is *structured*, and [loops are explicitly identified](#loop), which,
for example, allows decoders to ensure that program state is consistent at all
control flow merge points without having to see the entire function body first.
For more information, see the [Validation section](#validation).

A WebAssembly module can be [*instantiated*] to produce a WebAssembly instance,
which contains all the data structures required by the module's code for
execution. Instances can include [linear memory](#linear-memory), which can
serve the purpose of an address space for program data. For security and
determinism, linear memory is *sandboxed*, and the other data structures in an
instance, including the call stack, are allocated outside of linear memory so
that they cannot be corrupted by errant linear-memory accesses. Instances can
also include [tables](#tables), which can serve the purpose of an address space
for indirect function calls, among other things. An instance can then be
executed, either by execution of its [start function](#start-section) or by
calls to its exported functions.

Along with the other contents, each function contains a sequence of
*instructions*. WebAssembly instructions conceptually communicate with each
other primarily via pushing and popping values on a virtual stack, which allows
them to have a very compact encoding. For more information, see the
[Execution section](#execution).

WebAssembly has instructions for performing integer and floating-point
arithmetic, directing control flow, loading and storing to linear memory (as a
[load-store architecture]), calling functions, and more. For more information,
see the [Instructions section]. The [Instruction Descriptions section] provides
more information on how instructions are described.

Implementations of WebAssembly [validation] and [execution] need not perform all
the steps literally as described here; they need only behave ["as if"] they did
so in all observable respects.

Basics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. [Bytes](#bytes)
0. [Pages](#pages)
0. [Types](#types)
0. [Nondeterminism](#nondeterminism)
0. [Linear Memory](#linear-memory)
0. [Tables](#tables)

### Bytes

[*Bytes*] in WebAssembly are 8-[bit], and are the addressing unit of
[linear-memory] accesses.

[*Bytes*]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte

### Pages

[*Pages*] in WebAssembly are 64 [KiB], and are the units used in [linear-memory]
size declarations and size operations.

[*Pages*]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory)

### Types

0. [Integer Types](#integer-types)
0. [Floating-Point Types](#floating-point-types)

#### Integer Types

| Name  | Bits |
| ----- | ---- |
| `i32` | 32   |
| `i64` | 64   |

Integer types in WebAssembly aren't inherently signed or unsigned. They may be
interpreted as signed or unsigned by individual operations. When interpreted as
signed, a [two's complement] interpretation is used.

> The [minimum signed integer value] is supported; consequently, two's
complement signed integers aren't symmetric around zero.

> When used as linear-memory indices or function table indices, integer types
may play the role of "pointers".

##### Booleans

[Boolean][actual boolean] values in WebAssembly are represented as values of
type `i32`. In a boolean context, such as a `br_if` condition, any non-zero
value is interpreted as true and `0` is interpreted as false.

Any operation that produces a boolean value, such as a comparison, produces the
values `0` and `1` for false and true.

[actual boolean]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type

> The [binary format] often uses alternate encodings for integers and boolean
values, rather than using the literal encodings described here.

#### Floating-Point Types

| Name  | Bits |
| ----- | ---- |
| `f32` | 32   |
| `f64` | 64   |

`f32` in WebAssembly uses the IEEE 754-2008 [binary32] format, commonly known as
"single precision".

`f64` in WebAssembly uses the IEEE 754-2008 [binary64] format, commonly known as
"double precision".

> Unlike with [Numbers in ECMAScript], [NaN] values in WebAssembly have sign
bits and significand fields which may be observed and manipulated (though they
are usually unimportant).

[binary32]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format
[binary64]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format
[Numbers in ECMAScript]: https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type
[NaN]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN

### Nondeterminism

When semantics are specified as *nondeterministic*, a WebAssembly implementation
may perform any one of the specified alternatives.

> All instances of nondeterminism in WebAssembly are explicitly described as
such with a link to this section.

> There is no ["undefined behavior"] in WebAssembly where the semantics become
completely unspecified.

> There is no requirement that a given implementation make the same choice every
time, even for successive executions of the same instruction within the same
instance of a module.

["undefined behavior"]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior

### Linear Memory

A *linear memory space* is a contiguous, [byte]-addressable, readable and
writable range of memory spanning from offset `0` and extending up to a
*linear-memory size*, allocated as part of a WebAssembly instance. The size of a
linear memory is always a multiple of the [page] size and may be increased
dynamically (with the [`grow_memory`](#grow-memory) instruction) up to a
declared *maximum size*. Linear memory spaces are sandboxed, so they don't
overlap with each other or with other parts of a WebAssembly instance, including
the call stack, globals, and tables, and their bounds are enforced.

Linear-memory spaces can either be [defined by a module](#linear-memory-section)
or [imported](#import-section).

### Tables

A *table* is similar to a [linear-memory] space whose elements, instead of being
bytes, are opaque values of a particular *table element type*. Currently the
only valid element type is `"anyfunc"`, meaning a function with any signature. A
table of `"anyfunc"` is used as the index space for
[indirect calls](#indirect-call).

Tables can be [defined by a module](#table-section) or
[imported](#import-section).

> In the future, tables are expected to be generalized to hold a wide variety of
opaque values and serve a wide variety of purposes.


Module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. [Module Types](#module-types)
0. [Instantiation-Time Initializers](#instantiation-time-initializers)
0. [Module Contents](#module-contents)
0. [Known Sections](#known-sections)
0. [Module Index Spaces](#module-index-spaces)

### Module Types

These types describe various data structures present in WebAssembly modules:

0. [Index](#index)
0. [Array](#array)
0. [String](#string)

> These types aren't used to describe values at runtime.

#### Index

An *index* is a 32-bit unsigned integer value.

> Indices may be represented in compressed form in some representations.

#### Array

An *array* is an [index] indicating a number of elements, plus a sequence of
that many elements.

> Array elements needn't all be the same size in some representations.

#### String

A *string* is an [array] of bytes.

> Strings in this context may contain arbitrary bytes and aren't required to be
valid UTF-8 or any other format, and aren't required to be NUL-terminated.

### Instantiation-Time Initializers

An *instantiation-time initializer* is a single [instruction](#instructions),
which must be one of the following:
 - [`const`](#constant) (with any type prefix).
 - [`get_global`](#get-global).

The value produced by a module initializer is the value that such an instruction
would produce if it were executed within a function body.

**Validation:**
 - If the instruction is a `get_global`, the global index is required to be
   within the bounds of the [global index space], and the indexed global
   declaration is required to have the immutable flag set.

> In the future, more instructions may be permitted as instantiation-time
initializers.

### Module Contents

Modules contain a version [index].

Modules also contain a sequence of sections. Each section has a [string] *name*
and associated data.

**Validation:**
 - The version index is required to be equal to `0xc`.
 - For each present [known section](#known-sections), the requirements of its
   **Validation** clause are required, if one is specified for the section kind.
 - The requirements of the **Validation** clauses of every
   [index space](#module-index-spaces) are required, if one is specified for the
   index space.
 - Present known sections are required to be ordered in the section sequence as
   they are ordered in the [enumeration of the Known Sections](#known-sections).

> Some representations don't represent some of the known sections literally;
they may be combined with other sections or implied by specialized syntax.

> The initial release of WebAssembly will use an expected version of `0x0`.

### Known Sections

There are several *known sections*:

0. [Type Section]
0. [Import Section]
0. [Function Section]
0. [Table Section]
0. [Linear-Memory Section]
0. [Export Section]
0. [Start Section]
0. [Code Section]
0. [Data Section]
0. [Global Section]
0. [Element Section]
0. [Name Section]

TODO: What should the names and positions of the Global and Element sections be?

TODO: Reorder the known sections strategically?

TODO: Rename "Element Section" to "Elements Section"? Most of the other sections
use the singular, though "Data" is plural.

#### Type Section

**Name:** `type`.

The Type Section consists of an [array] of function signatures.

Each *function signature* consists of:
 - a *parameter list*, which is an [array] of [types].
 - a *return list*, which is also an [array] of [types].

**Validation:**
 - Each return list is required to contain at most one element.

> In the future, this section may contain other forms of type entries as well,
and support for function signatures with multiple return types.

#### Import Section

**Name:** `import`

The Import Section consists of an [array] of imports.

An *import* is one of the following:
 - a function import.
 - a linear-memory import.
 - a global import.
 - a table import.

All imports contain:
 - a *module [string]*.
 - a *name [string]*.

A *function import* additionally contains:
 - a function declaration, as described in the [Function Section].

A *linear-memory import* additionally contains:
 - a linear-memory declaration, as described in the [Linear-Memory Section].

A *global import* additionally contains:
 - a global declaration, as described in the [Global Section].

A *table import* additionally contains:
 - a table declaration, as described in the [Table Section].

The meaning of the module string and name string are determined by the embedding
environment.

Imports provide access to constructs, defined and allocated by external entities
outside the scope of this specification (though they may be exports provided by
other WebAssembly modules), but which have behavior consistent with their
corresponding concepts defined in this spec. They can be accessed through their
respective [module index spaces](#module-index-spaces).

**Validation:**
 - All global imports must be immutable.
 - Each global import with an initializer is required to be mutable.
 - Each import is required to be resolved by the embedder.
 - A linear-memory import's initial size is required to be at most the imported
   linear-memory space's initial size.
 - A linear-memory import's maximum size is required to be at least the imported
   linear-memory space's maximum size.
 - A table import's initial length is required to be at most the imported
   table's initial length.
 - A table import's maximum length is required to be at least the imported
   table's maximum length.
 - Embedding-specific validation may be performed on each import.

> Global imports may be permitted to be mutable in the future.

> The module string will often identify a module to import from, and the name
string an export in that module to import, but embedding environments may
provide other mechanisms for resolving imports as well.

#### Function Section

**Name:** `function`

The Function Section consists of an [array] of function declarations. Its
elements directly correspond to elements in the [Code Section] array.

A *function declaration* consists of:
 - an index in the [Type Section] of the signature of the function.

**Validation:**
 - The array is required to be the same length as the [Code Section] array.

#### Table Section

**Name:** `table`

The Table Section consists of an [array] of [table] declarations.

A *table declaration* consists of:
 - A *default* flag.
 - An *element type*, for which the only valid value is `"anyfunc"`.
 - An *initial length*.
 - A *maximum length*.

Tables with an element type of `"anyfunc"` hold function references of any type.

> Additional elements types may be added in the future.

#### Linear-Memory Section

**Name:** `memory`

The Memory Section consists of an array of [linear-memory] declarations.

A *linear-memory declaration* contains:
 - An *index bitwidth* [index]. Within the context of this linear memory, `iPTR`
   refers to an integer type with this bitwidth.
 - An *initial size*, which is an unsigned `iPTR` value, in units of [pages].
 - A *maximum size*, which is an unsigned `iPTR` value, in units of [pages]. See
   the [`grow_memory`](#grow-memory) instruction for further information on this
   field.
 - A *default* flag, which is a boolean value indicating whether the
   linear-memory space is to be the default linear-memory space for the module.

TODO: The index bitwidth field anticipates a proposal to add this flag.

TODO: Change the **Name** to be "linear-memory"?

> Implementations are encouraged to attempt to reserve enough resources for
allocating up to the maximum size up front. Otherwise, implementations are
encouraged to allocate only enough for the initial size up front.

#### Export Section

**Name:** `export`

The Export Section consists of an [array] of exports.

An *export* is one of the following:
 - a function export.
 - a linear-memory export.
 - a global export.
 - a table export.

All exports contain:
 - a *name [string]*.

An *function export* additionally contains:
 - an [index] of a function in the [function index space] to export.

A *linear-memory export* additionally contains:
 - an [index] of a linear-memory space in the [linear-memory index space] to
   export.

A *global export* additionally contains:
 - an [index] of a global in the [global index space] to export.

A *table export* additionally contains:
 - an [index] of a table in the [table index space] to export.

The meaning of the module string and name string are determined by the embedding
environment.

Exports provide access to an instance's constructs to external entities outside
the scope of this specification (though they may be other WebAssembly modules),
but which have behavior consistent with their corresponding concepts defined in
this spec.

**Validation:**
 - Each export's name is required to be unique among all the exports' names.
 - Each export's index is required to be within the bounds of its associated
   index space.

> Because exports reference index spaces which include imports, modules can
re-export their imports.

#### Start Section

**Name:** `start`

The Start Section consists of an [index] into the [function index space]. See
[Instance Execution](#instance-execution) for further information.

**Validation:**
 - The index is required to be within the bounds of the [Code Section] array.
 - The function signature indexed in the [Type Section] is required to have an
   empty parameter list and an empty return list.

#### Code Section

**Name:** `code`

The Code Section consists of an [array] of function bodies.

A *function body* consists of:
 - an [array] of [types], which declare the number and types of locals.
 - a sequence of [instructions](#instructions).

> Validation of function bodies is described
[separately](#function-body-validation).

##### Positions Within A Function Body

A *position* within a function refers to an element of the instruction sequence.

> In the [binary format], positions are represented as byte offsets; in the
[text format], positions are represented with a special syntax.

#### Data Section

**Name:** `data`

The Data Section consists of an [array] of data initializers.

A *data initializer* consists of:
 - a linear-memory index.
 - a *start offset* which is an
   [instantiation-time initializer](#instantiation-time-initializers).
 - a [string] of data.

It describes data to be loaded into the linear memory identified by the index in
the [linear-memory index space] during
[linear-memory instantiation](#linear-memory-instantiation).

**Validation:**
 - For each data initializer in the array:
    - The linear-memory index is required to be within the bounds of the
      linear-memory index space.
    - A linear-memory space is identified by the linear-memory index in the
      linear-memory index space and:
       - The sum of the start offset and the length of the string is required to
         be at most the initial size declared for the linear-memory space.
       - The start offset is required to be greater than the index of any byte
         in the linear-memory space that will be initialized by a prior
         data initializer in the array.

#### Global Section

**Name:** `global`

The Global Section consists of an [array] of global declarations.

A *global declaration* consists of:
 - A [type].
 - An *immutable* flag.
 - An optional *initializer*, which is an
   [instantiation-time initializer](#instantiation-time-initializers).

#### Element Section

**Name:** `element`

The Element Section consists of an [array] of table initializers.

A *table initializer* consists of:
 - a table index.
 - a *start offset* which is an
   [instantiation-time initializer](#instantiation-time-initializers).
 - an [array] of table element initializers.

A *table element initializer* consists of:
 - an index-space selector, which conceptually identifies an index space and for
   which the only valid value is "the function index Space".
 - an index into the selected space.

**Validation:**
 - For each table initializer in the array:
    - The table index is required to be within the bounds of the table index
      space.
    - A table is identified by the table index in the table space and:
       - The sum of the start offset and the length of
         the element initializer array is required to be at most the initial
         size declared for the table.
       - The start offset is required to be greater than the index of any
         element in the table that will be initialized by a prior table
         initializer in the array.
       - For each element of the indexed table element initializer:
          - The type of the elements of the selected index space are required to
            be compatible with the type of the table to be initialized.
          - The index is required to be within the bounds of the selected index
            space.

> The Element Sections is to the [Table Section] as the [Data Section] is to the
[Linear-Memory Section].

> Initializers may be able to reference other index spaces in the future.

TODO: Rename this to the Table Initializer Section?

#### Name Section

**Name:** `name`

The Names Section consists of an [array] of function name descriptors, which
each describe names for the function with the corresponding index in the
[function index space] and which consist of:
 - the function name, a [string].
 - the names of the locals in the function, an [array] of [strings].

The Names Section doesn't change execution semantics and malformed constructs,
such as out-of-bounds indices, in this section cause the section to be ignored,
and don't trigger validation failures.

> Name data is represented as an explicit section in the [binary format],
however in the [text format] it may be represented as an integrated part of the
syntax for functions rather than as a discrete section.

> The expectation is that, when a binary WebAssembly module is presented in a
human-readable format in a browser or other development environment, the names
in this section are to be used as the names of functions and locals in the
[text format].

TODO: Should the names in this section be required to be valid UTF-8 strings?
This section isn't used during normal validation or execution, so it's off the
"hot path" and is only used during debugging, to present strings to humans, so
it might make sense.

### Module Index Spaces

Module Index Spaces are abstract mappings from indices, starting from zero, to
various types of elements.

0. [Function Index Space]
0. [Global Index Space]
0. [Linear-Memory Index Space]
0. [Table Index Space]

#### Function Index Space

The *function index space* begins with an index for each imported function, in
the order the imports appear in the [Import Section], if present, followed by an
index for each function in the [Function Section], if present, in the order of
that section.

**Validation:**
 - For each element in the index space, the type index is required to be within
   the bounds of the [Type Section] array.

> The function index space is used by [`call`](#call) instructions to identify
the callee of a direct call.

#### Global Index Space

The *global index space* begins with an index for each imported global, in the
order the imports appear in the [Import Section], if present, followed by an
index for each global in the [Global Section], if present, in the order of that
section.

> The global index space is used by:
 - the [`get_global`](#get-global) and [`set_global`](#set-global) instructions.
 - the [Data Section], to define the offset of a data segment (in linear memory)
   as the value of a global variable.

#### Linear-Memory Index Space

The *linear-memory index space* begins with an index for each imported linear
memory, in the order the imports appear in the [Import Section], if present,
followed by an index for each linear-memory space in the
[Linear-Memory Section], if present, in the order of that section.

**Validation:**
 - The index space is required to have at most one element.
 - For each linear-memory declaration in the index space:
    - The maximum size is required to be at least the initial size.
    - The index of every byte in a linear memory with the maximum size is
      required to be representable in an unsigned `iPTR`.
    - The index bitwidth is required to be `32`.
    - The default flag is required to be true.

> The validation rules here specifically avoid requiring the size in bytes of
linear memory to be representable as an unsigned `iPTR`. For example a 32-bit
linear-memory address space could theoretically be resized to 4 GiB if the
implementation has sufficient resources; the index of every byte would be
addressable, even though the total number of bytes would not be.

> Multiple linear-memory spaces may be permitted in the future.

> 64-bit linear-memory spaces may be permitted in the future.

#### Table Index Space

The *table index space* begins with an index for each imported table, in the
order the imports appear in the [Import Section], if present, followed by an
index for each table in the [Table Section], if present, in the order of that
section.

**Validation:**
 - The index space is required to contain at most one table.
 - Exactly one table is required to have the default flag set to true.
 - Each table's maximum length is required to be at least its initial length.

> The table index space is currently only used by the [Element Section].


Binary Format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: Describe the binary format. The high-level ideas are:
 - A module starts with a *magic cookie*, consisting of the 4-byte sequence
   0x00, 0x61, 0x73, 0x6d, followed by the [version](#module-contents) [index],
   followed by the encodings of the sections.
 - Most module [indices] values are typically encoded with [LEB128].
 - Module [arrays] values are encoded as the length [index] followed by the
   encodings of the elements.
 - Every [instruction](#instructions) is encoded as its Opcode value, followed
   by its immediate operand values.
 - Most immediate operand values are encoded with [LEB128], though there are
   several special cases.
 - Function bodies end with an implicit [`end`](#end) instruction.

[LEB128]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128

> The magic cookie bytes begin with a NUL, indicating to tools that the ensuing
contents are not generally "text", followed by the UTF-8 encoding of the string
"asm".

TODO: Renumber the opcodes strategically?

TODO: Will the `end` be made explicit? Monitor
https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/pull/666


Text Format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: What will the text format look like? Monitor at least
https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/pull/704


Validation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. [Module Validation](#module-validation)
0. [Function-Body Validation](#function-body-validation)

### Module Validation

Validation of a module requires the requirements of the **Validation** clause of
the [top-level module description](#module-contents).

Then, if the module contains a [Code Section], each function body in the section
is [validated](#function-body-validation).

### Function-Body Validation

The requirements for function-body validation are:
 - The instruction sequence is required to be non-empty, and the last
   instruction in the sequence is required to be an [`end`](#end).
 - Control-flow constructs are required to form properly nested *regions*. Each
   [`loop`](#loop), [`block`](#block), and the function entry begin a region
   required to be terminated with an [`end`](#end). Each [`if`](#if) begins a
   region terminated with either an [`end`](#end) or an [`else`](#else). Each
   [`else`](#else) begins a region terminated with an [`end`](#end). Each `end`
   and each `else` terminates exactly one region.
 - Branches to labels must be from within the region bounded by the instruction
   that binds the label.
 - The sequence of values that would be on the value stack at execution of each
   instruction is required be the same for all possible control-flow paths to
   that instruction.
 - The [types] of the operands passed to each instruction are required to
   conform to the instruction's signature's operands.
 - At each instruction, all values that will be popped from the value stack at
   that instruction are required to have been pushed within the same region (or
   within a region nested inside it).
 - For each instruction, the requirements of the **Validation** clause in the
   associated instruction description are required.

> The final [`end`](#end) instruction may be implicit in some representations.

> These requirements are sufficient to ensure that WebAssembly has
*reducible control flow*, which essentially means that all loops have exactly
one entry point.

> There are no implicit type conversions, subtyping, or function overloading in
WebAssembly.


Execution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Module Instantiation

WebAssembly code execution requires an *instance* of a module, which contains a
reference to the module plus additional information added during instantiation,
which consists of the following steps:
 - The entire module is first [validated](#validation). If there are any
   failures, instantiation aborts and doesn't produce an instance.
 - If a [Linear-Memory Section] is present, each linear-memory space is
   [instantiated](#linear-memory-instantiation).
 - If a [Table Section] is present, each table is
   [instantiated](#table-instantiation).
 - A finite quantity of [call-stack resources] is allocated.
 - A *globals array* is allocated, which is a heterogeneous array of globals
   corresponding to the entries in the module's [Global Section]. The initial
   value of each global is the value of its
   [instantiation-time initializer](#instantiation-time-initializers), if it has
   one, or an all-zeros bit-pattern otherwise.

> The contents of an instance, including functions and their bodies, are outside
any linear address space and not any accessible to applications. WebAssembly is
therefore conceptually a [Harvard Architecture].

#### Linear-Memory Instantiation

A linear-memory space declared in the [linear-memory index space] may be
instantiated as follows:

For a linear-memory definition in the [Linear-Memory Section], as opposed to a
[linear-memory import](#import-section), an array of [bytes] with the length
being the value of the linear-memory space's initial size field is created,
added to the instance, and initialized to all zeros. For a linear-memory import,
storage for the array is already allocated.

The contents of the [Data Section] are loaded into the byte array. Each [string]
is loaded into linear memory starting at its associated start offset value.

**Trap:** Dynamic Resource Exhaustion, if dynamic resources are insufficient to
support creation of the array.

#### Table Instantiation

A table declared in the [table index space] may be instantiated as follows:

For a table definition in the [Table Section], as opposed to a
[table import](#import-section), an array of elements is created with the
table's initial length, with elements of the table's element type, and
initialized to all special "null" values specific to the element type. For a
table import, storage for the table is already allocated.

For each table initializer in the [Element Section], for the table identified by
the table index in the [table index space]:
 - A contiguous of elements in the table starting at the table initializer's
   start offset is initialized according to the elements of the table element
   initializers array, which specify an indexed element in their selected index
   space.

**Trap:** Dynamic Resource Exhaustion, if dynamic resources are insufficient to
support creation of any of the tables.

#### Call-Stack Resources

Call-stack resources are an abstract quantity, with discrete units, of which a
[nondeterministic] amount is allocated during instantiation, belonging to an
instance.

> These resources is used by [call instructions][L].

> The specific resource limit serves as an upper bound only; implementations may
[nondeterministically] perform a trap sooner if they exhaust other dynamic
resources.

### Instance Execution

If the module contains a [Start Section], the referenced function is
[executed](#function-execution).

### Function Execution

Function execution can be prompted by a [call-family instruction][L], by
[instance execution](#instance-execution), or by the embedding environment.

The input to execution of a function consists of:
 - the function to be executed.
 - the incoming argument values, one for each parameter [type] of the function.

For the duration of the execution of a function body, several data structures
are created:
 - A *control-flow stack*, with each entry containing
    - a [label] for reference from branch instructions.
    - a *limit* integer value, which is an index into the value stack indicating
      where to reset it to on a branch to that label.
 - A *value stack*, which carries values between instructions.
 - A *locals* array, a heterogeneous array of values containing an element for
   each type in the function's parameter list, followed by an element for each
   local declaration in the function.
 - A *current position*.

> Implementations needn't create a literal array to store the locals, or literal
stacks to manage values at runtime.

> These data structures are all allocated outside any linear-address space and
are not any accessible to applications.

#### Function Execution Initialization

The current position starts at the first instruction in the function body. The
value stack begins empty. The control-flow stack begins with an entry holding a
[label] bound to the last instruction in the instruction sequence and a limit
value of zero.

The value of each incoming argument is copied to the local with the
corresponding index, and the rest of the locals are initialized to all-zeros
bit-pattern values.

#### Function-Body Execution

The instruction at the current position is remembered, and the current position
is incremented to point to the position following it. Then the remembered
instruction is executed as follows:

For each operand [type] in the instruction's signature in reverse order, a value
is popped from the value stack and provided as the corresponding operand value.
The instruction is then executed as described in the
[Instructions Section](#instructions) entry describing it. Each of the
instruction's return values are then pushed onto the value stack.

If the current position is now past the end of the sequence,
[function return execution](#function-return-execution) is initiated and
execution of the function is thereafter complete.

Otherwise, [execution](#function-body-execution) is restarted with the new
current position.

**Trap:** Dynamic Resource Exhaustion, if any dynamic resource used by the
implementation is exhausted, at any point during function-body execution.

#### Labels

A label is a value which is either *unbound*, or *bound* to a specific position.

#### Instruction Traps

Instructions may *trap*, in which case execution of the current instance is
immediately terminated and abnormal termination is reported to the embedding
environment.

> Except for the call stack and the state of any executing functions, the
contents of an instance, including the linear memory, are left intact after a
trap. This allows inspection by debugging tools and crash reporters. It is also
valid to call exported functions in an instance that has trapped.

#### Function Return Execution

One value for each return [type] in the function signature in reverse order is
popped from the value stack. If the function execution was prompted by a
[call instruction][L], these values are provided as the call's return values.
Otherwise, they are provided to the embedding environment.


Instruction Descriptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions in the [Instructions](#instructions) section are introduced with
tables giving a concise description of several of their attributes, followed by
additional content.

0. [Instruction Mnemonic Field](#instruction-mnemonic-field)
0. [Instruction Immediates Field](#instruction-immediates-field)
0. [Instruction Signature Field](#instruction-signature-field)
0. [Instruction Families Field](#instruction-families-field)
0. [Instruction Opcode Field](#instruction-opcode-field)
0. [Instruction Syntax Field](#instruction-syntax-field)
0. [Instruction Description](#instruction-description)

### Instruction Mnemonic Field

Instruction [mnemonics] are short names identifying specific instructions.

Many instructions have type-specific behavior, in which case there is a unique
mnemonic for each type, formed by prepending a *type prefix*, such as `i32.` or
`f64.`, to the base instruction mnemonic.

Conversion instructions have additional type-specific behavior; their mnemonic
additionally has a *type suffix* appended, such as `/i32` or `/f64`, indicating
the input type.

The base mnemonics for [signed][S] and [unsigned][U] instructions have the
convention of ending in "_s" and "_u" respectively.

[mnemonics]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Opcode_mnemonics_and_extended_mnemonics

### Instruction Immediates Field

Immediates, if present, is a list of [typed] value names, representing values
provided by the module itself as input to an instruction.

As a special case, an immediate field can also contain `TABLE`, which signifies
a branch table, which is a sequence of immediate integer values. This is for use
in the [`br_table`](#table-branch) instruction.

### Instruction Signature Field

Instruction signatures describe the explicit inputs and outputs to an
instruction. They are described in the following form:

`(` *operands* `)` `:` `(` *returns* `)`

*Operands* describes a list of [types] for values provided by program execution
as input to an instruction. *returns* describes a list of [types] for values
computed by the instruction that are provided back to the program execution.

Within the signature for a [linear-memory access instruction][M], `iPTR` refers
an integer [type] with the index bitwidth of the accessed linear-memory space.

Besides literal [types], descriptions of [types] can be from the following
mechanisms:
 - A [typed] value name of the form

   *name*`:` *type*

   where *name* just provides an identifier for use in
   [instruction descriptions](#instruction-description). It is replaced by
   *type*.
 - A type parameter list of the form

   *name*`[` *length* `]`

   where *name* identifies the list, and *length* gives the length of the list.
   The length may be a literal value, an immediate operand value, or one of the
   named values defined below. Each type parameter in the list may be *bound* to
   a type as described in the instruction's description, or it may be inferred
   from the type of a corresponding operand value. The parameter list is
   replaced by the types bound to its parameters. If the list appears multiple
   times in a signature, it is replaced by the same types at each appearance.

The following named values are defined:
 - `$args` is defined in [call instructions][L] and indicates the length of the
   callee signature parameter list.
 - `$returns` is also defined in [call instructions][L] and indicates the length
   of callee signature return list.
 - `$any` indicates the number of values on the value stack pushed within the
   enclosing region.

### Instruction Families Field

WebAssembly instructions may belong to several families, indicated in the tables
by their family letter:

0. [B: Branch Instruction Family][B]
0. [Q: Control-Flow Barrier Instruction Family][Q]
0. [L: Call Instruction Family][L]
0. [G: Generic Integer Instruction Family][G]
0. [S: Signed Integer Instruction Family][S]
0. [U: Unsigned Integer Instruction Family][U]
0. [T: Shift Instruction Family][T]
0. [F: Floating-Point Instruction Family][F]
0. [Z: Floating-Point Bitwise Instruction Family][Z]
0. [C: Comparison Instruction Family][C]
0. [M: Linear-Memory Access Instruction Family][M]
0. [R: Linear-Memory Size Instruction Family][R]

#### B: Branch Instruction Family

##### Branching

In a branch according to a given control-flow stack entry, first the value stack
is resized down to the entry's limit value.

Then, if the entry's [label] is bound, the current position is set to the bound
position. Otherwise, the position to bind the label to is found by scanning
forward through the instructions, as if executing just [`block`](#block),
[`loop`](#loop), and [`end`](#end) instructions, until the label is bound. Then
the current position is set to that position.

Then, control-flow stack entries are popped until the given control-flow stack
entry is popped.

> In practice, implementations may precompute the destinations of branches so
that they don't literally need to scan in this manner.

> Branching is sometimes called "jumping" in other languages.

#### Q: Control-Flow Barrier Instruction Family

These instructions either trap or reassign the current position, such that
execution doesn't proceed to the instruction that lexically follows them.

#### L: Call Instruction Family

##### Calling

If the called function&mdash;the *callee*&mdash;is a function in the module, it
is [executed](#function-execution). Otherwise the callee is an imported function
which is executed according to its own semantics. The `$args` operands,
excluding `$callee` when present, are passed as the incoming arguments. The
return value of the call is defined by the execution.

At least one unit of [call-stack resources] is consumed during the execution of
the callee, and released when it completes.

**Trap:** Call Stack Exhausted, if the instance has insufficient
[call-stack resources].

> This means that implementations aren't permitted to perform implicit
opportunistic tail-call elimination.

> The execution state of the function currently being executed remains live
during the call, and the execution of the called function is performed
independently. In this way, calls form a stack-like data structure called the
*call stack*.

> Data associated with the call stack is stored outside any linear address space
and isn't directly accessible to applications.

##### Call Validation

 - The members of `$T[$args]` are bound to the operand types of the callee
   signature, and the members of `$T[$returns]` are bound to the return types of
   the callee signature.
 - `$arity` is required to be equal to `$args`.

> The `$arity` immediate operand provides no semantic content other than its
validation requirement.

#### G: Generic Integer Instruction Family

Except where otherwise specified, these instructions don't specifically
interpret their operands as explicitly signed or unsigned, and therefore don't
have an inherent concept of overflow.

#### S: Signed Integer Instruction Family

Except where otherwise specified, these instructions interpret their operand
values as signed, return result values interpreted as signed, and [trap] when
the result value can't be represented as such.

#### U: Unsigned Integer Instruction Family

Except where otherwise specified, these instructions interpret their operand
values as unsigned, return result values interpreted as unsigned, and [trap]
when the result value can't be represented as such.

#### T: Shift Instruction Family

In the shift and rotate instructions, *left* means in the direction of greater
significance, and *right* means in the direction of lesser significance.

##### Shift Count

The second operand in shift and rotate instructions specifies a *shift count*,
which is interpreted as an unsigned quantity modulo the number of bits in the
first operand.

> As a result of the modulo, in `i32.` instructions, only the least-significant
5 bits of the second operand affect the result, and in `i64.` instructions only
the least-significant 6 bits of the second operand affect the result.

> The shift count is interpreted as unsigned even in otherwise signed
instructions such as [`shr_s`](#integer-shift-right-signed).

#### F: Floating-Point Instruction Family

Instructions in this family follow the [IEEE 754-2008] standard, except that:

 - They support only "non-stop" mode, and floating-point exceptions aren't
   otherwise observable. In particular, neither alternate floating-point
   exception handling attributes nor the non-computational operations on status
   flags are supported.

 - They use the IEEE 754-2008 `roundTiesToEven` rounding attribute, except where
   otherwise specified. Non-default directed rounding attributes aren't
   supported.

When the result of any instruction in this family (which excludes `neg`, `abs`,
and `copysign`) is a NaN, the sign bit and the significand field (which doesn't
include the implicit leading digit of the significand) of the NaN are computed
by one of the following rules, selected [nondeterministically]:

 - If the instructions has any NaN non-immediate operand values, implementations
   may [nondeterministically] select any of them to be the result value, but
   with the most significant bit of the significand field overwritten to be `1`.

 - If the implementation doesn't choose to use an input NaN as a result value,
   or if there are no input NaNs, the result value has a [nondeterministic] sign
   bit, a significand field with `1` in the most significant bit and `0` in the
   remaining bits.

TODO: How does NaN propagation work? Monitor
https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/pull/713

Implementations are permitted to further implement the IEEE 754-2008 section
"Operations with NaNs" recommendation that operations propagate NaN bits from
their operands, however it isn't required.

> The exception and rounding behavior specified here are the default behavior on
most contemporary software environments.

> All computations are correctly rounded, subnormal values are fully supported,
and negative zero, NaNs, and infinities are all produced as result values to
indicate overflow, invalid, and divide-by-zero exceptional conditions, and
interpreted appropriately when they appear as operands. Compiler optimizations
that introduce changes to the effective precision, rounding, or range of any
computation are not permitted. All numeric results are deterministic, as are the
rules for how NaNs are handled as operands and for when NaNs are to be generated
as results. The only floating-point nondeterminism is in the specific
bit-patterns of NaN result values.

> In IEEE 754-1985, ["subnormal numbers"] are called "denormal numbers";
WebAssembly follows IEEE 754-2008, which calls them "subnormal numbers".

> There is no observable difference between quiet and signaling NaN other than
the difference in the bit pattern.

[IEEE 754-2008]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point
["subnormal numbers"]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnormal_number

#### Z: Floating-Point Bitwise Instruction Family

These instructions operate on floating-point values, but do so in purely bitwise
ways, including in how they operate on NaN and zero values.

They correspond to the "Sign bit operations" in IEEE 754-2008.

#### C: Comparison Instruction Family

WebAssembly comparison instructions compare two values and return a [boolean]
result value.

> In accordance with IEEE 754-2008, for the comparison instructions, negative
zero is considered equal to zero, and NaN values aren't less than, greater than,
or equal to any other values, including themselves.

#### M: Linear-Memory Access Instruction Family

These instructions load from and store to a linear-memory space.

##### Effective Address

The *effective address* of a linear-memory access is computed by adding `$base`
and `$offset`, both interpreted as unsigned, at infinite range and precision, so
that there is no overflow.

##### Alignment

**Slow:** If the effective address isn't a multiple of `$align`, the access is
*misaligned*, and the instruction may execute very slowly.

> When `$align` is at least the size of the access, the access is
*naturally aligned*. When it's less, the access is *unaligned*. Naturally
aligned accesses may be faster than unaligned accesses, though both may be much
faster than misaligned accesses.

> There is no other semantic effect associated with `$align`; misaligned and
unaligned loads and stores still behave normally.

##### Accessed Bytes

The *accessed bytes* consist of a contiguous sequence of [bytes] starting at the
[effective address], with a length implied by the accessing instruction.

**Trap:** Out Of Bounds, if any of the accessed bytes are beyond the end of the
accessed linear-memory space.

> Linear-memory accesses trap on an out-of-bound access, which differs from
[TypedArrays in ECMAScript] where storing out of bounds silently does nothing
and loading out of bounds silently returns `undefined`.

[TypedArrays in ECMAScript]: https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-typedarray-objects

##### Loading

For a load access, a value is read from the [accessed bytes], in
[little-endian byte order], and returned.

##### Storing

For a store access, the value to store is written to the [accessed bytes], in
[little-endian byte order].

> If any of the bytes are out of bounds, the Out Of Bounds trap is triggered
before any of the bytes are written to.

##### Linear-Memory Access Validation

 - `$align` is required to be a [power of 2].
 - `$align` is required to be at most the number of [accessed bytes].
 - The module is required to contain a default linear-memory space.

TODO: Will offsets be encoded as signed? Monitor
https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/584

#### R: Linear-Memory Size Instruction Family

##### Linear-Memory Size Validation

 - The module is required to contain a default linear-memory space.

TODO: Should linear-memory size instructions have a linear-memory-space
immediate?

### Instruction Opcode Field

These values are used in the [binary format](#binary-format) to encode
instruction [opcodes].

[opcodes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode

### Instruction Syntax Field

TODO: These are suggested operator names for use in the [text format]. A
parenthesized number is given for each operator name giving a suggested operator
[precedence] value when binary operators use infix notation and unary operators
use prefix notation.

### Instruction Description

Instruction semantics are described for use in the context of
[function-body execution](#function-body-execution). Some instructions also have
a special validation clause, introduced by "**Validation:**", which are for use
in the context of [function-body validation](#function-body-validation).

| `block`     | `() : ()`                   |          | 0x01   |

The `block` instruction pushes an entry onto the control-flow stack. The entry
contains an unbound [label] and the current length of the value stack.

> Each `block` needs a corresponding [`end`](#end) to bind its label and pop
its control-flow stack entry.

#### Loop

| `loop`      | `() : ()`                   |          | 0x02   |

The `loop` instruction binds a [label] to the current position, and pushes an
entry onto the control-flow stack. The entry contains that label and the current
length of the value stack.

> The `loop` instruction doesn't perform a loop by itself. It merely introduces
a label that may be used by a branch to form an actual loop.

> Since `loop`'s control-flow stack entry starts with an empty type sequence,
branches to the top of the loop must not have any result values.

> Each `loop` needs a corresponding [`end`](#end) to pop its control-flow stack
entry.

> There is no requirement that loops eventually terminate or contain observable
side effects.

The `br` instruction [branches](#branching) according to the control-flow stack
entry `$depth` from the top. It returns the values of its operands.

**Validation:**

If `$condition` is [true], the `br_if` instruction [branches](#branching)
according to the control-flow stack entry `$depth` from the top. Otherwise, it
does nothing. It returns the values of its operands, except `$condition`.

**Validation:**
 - `$arity` is required to be at most 0.

> This instruction's `$arity` has a different constraint than others; this is
intentional and possibly temporary.

TODO: Will `br_if`'s `$arity` be changed? Monitor

#### Table Branch

| Mnemonic    | Immediates                          | Signature                                  | Families | Opcode |

| `br_table`  | `$arity: i32, TABLE, $default: i32` | `($T[$arity], $index: i32) : ($T[$arity])` | [B] [Q]  | 0x08   |

First, the `br_table` instruction selects a depth to use. If `$index` is within
the bounds of the table, the depth is the value of the indexed table element.
Otherwise, the depth is `$default`.

Then, it [branches](#branching) according to the control-flow stack entry that
depth from the top. It returns the values of its operands, except `$index`.

**Validation:**
 - `$arity` is required to be at most 1.

> This instruction serves the role of what is sometimes called a ["jump table"]
in other languages. "Branch" is used here instead to emphasize the commonality
with the other branch instructions.

| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `if`        | `($condition: i32) : ()`    | [B]      | 0x03   |

The `if` instruction pushes an entry onto the control-flow stack. The entry
contains an unbound [label] and the current length of the value stack. If
`$condition` is [false], it then [branches](#branching) to this label.

TODO: Do `if` and `else` have labels? Monitor at least
https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/pull/710

| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `else`      | `($T[$any]) : ($T[$any])`     | [B]      | 0x04   |

The `else` instruction binds the control-flow stack top's [label] to the current
position, pops an entry from the control-flow stack, pushes a new entry onto the
control-flow stack containing an unbound [label] and the length of the current
value stack, and then [branches](#branching) to the new label. It returns the
values of its operands.

> Each `else` needs a corresponding [`end`](#end) to bind its label and pop its
control-flow stack entry.

#### End

| Mnemonic    | Signature                     | Families | Opcode |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `end`       | `($T[$any]) : ($T[$any])`     |          | 0x0f   |

The `end` instruction pops an entry from the control-flow stack. If the entry's
[label] is unbound, the label is bound to the current position. It returns the
values of its operands.

**Validation:**
 - `$any` is required to be at most 1.

> Each `end` ends a region begun by a corresponding `block`, `loop`, `if`,
`else`, or the function entry.

#### Return

| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `return`    | `$arity: i32` | `($T[$arity]) : ($T[$arity])` | [B] [Q]  | 0x09   |

The `return` instruction [branches](#branching) according to the control-flow
stack bottom. It returns the values of its operands.

**Validation:**
 - `$arity` is required to be at most 1.

> `return` is semantically equivalent to a `br` to the outermost control region.

> Implementations needn't literally perform a branch before performing the
actual function return.

#### Unreachable

| Mnemonic      | Signature                 | Families | Opcode |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `unreachable` | `() : ()`                 | [Q]      | 0x0a   |

**Trap:** Unreachable reached, always.

The `rem_s` instruction returns the signed remainder from a division of its
operand values interpreted as signed, with the result having the same sign as
the first operand (the dividend).

**Trap:** Integer Division By Zero, when the second operand (the divisor) is
zero.

> This instruction doesn't trap when the [minimum signed integer value] is
divided by `-1`; it returns `0` which is the correct remainder (even though the
same operands to `div_s` do cause a trap).

> This instruction differs from what is often called a ["modulo" operation] in
its handling of negative numbers.

### Additional Memory-Related Instructions

0. [Grow Linear-Memory Size](#grow-linear-memory-size)
0. [Current Linear-Memory Size](#current-linear-memory-size)

#### Grow Linear-Memory Size

| Mnemonic      | Signature                 | Families | Opcode |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `grow_memory` | `(iPTR) : (iPTR)`         | [R]      | 0x39   |

The `grow_memory` instruction increases the size of the referenced linear-memory
space by a given unsigned amount, in units of [pages]. If the index of any byte
of the referenced linear-memory space would be unrepresentable in an unsigned
`iPTR`, if allocation fails due to insufficient dynamic resources, or if the
linear-memory size would exceed the linear-memory space's maximum size, it
returns `-1`; otherwise it returns the previous linear-memory size, also as an
unsigned value in units of [pages]. Newly allocated bytes are initialized to
all zeros.

**Validation**:
 - [Linear-memory size validation](#linear-memory-size-validation) is required.

> This instruction can fail even when the maximum size is not yet reached.

> Since the return value is in units of pages, `-1` isn't otherwise a valid
linear-memory size.

TODO: Rename this and `current_memory` to have "linear" in the mnemonic?
