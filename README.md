# spec

This repository holds the official specifications and reference implementations
for WebAssembly.

At this time, the contents of this repository are under development and known
to be incomplet and inkorrect.

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
(guidelines for contributing)[Contributing.md].
