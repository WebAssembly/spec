# spec

This repository holds the official specifications and reference implementations
for WebAssembly.

At this time, the contents of this repository are under development and known
to be incomplet and inkorrect. _(puns intended)_

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).
