# 128-bit arithemtic proposal for WebAssembly.

This repository is a clone of
[`WebAssembly/spec`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/). It is meant for
discussion, prototype specification, and implementation of a proposal to add
support for 128-bit arithmetic instructions for WebAssembly.

* See the [overview](./proposals/128-bit-arithmetic/Overview.md) for a
  high-level summary and rationale of the proposal.

Original README from upstream repository follows...

# spec

This repository holds the sources for the WebAssembly draft specification
(to seed a future
[WebAssembly Working Group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2017Jun/0005.html)),
a reference implementation, and the official testsuite.

A formatted version of the spec is available here:
[webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/),

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).
