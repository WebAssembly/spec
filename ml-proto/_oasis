Synopsis:    This repository implements a prototypical reference interpreter
  for WebAssembly
Description: It is written for clarity and simplicity, not speed (although it should be reasonably fast). Hopefully, it can be useful as a playground for trying out ideas and a device for nailing down the exact semantics. For that purpose, the code is written in a fairly declarative, "speccy" way.
