# WebAssembly Specification

This is (meant to become) the official WebAssembly "language" specification.

It uses [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/). To install that:
```
pip install sphinx
```
To make HTML (result in `_build/html`):
```
make html
```
To make PDF (result in `_build/latex`, requires LaTeX):
```
make pdf
```
To make all:
```
make all
```
