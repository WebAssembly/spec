# WebAssembly Core Specification

This is the official WebAssembly "language" specification.

It uses [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/). To install that:
```
pip install sphinx
```
To make HTML (result in `_build/html`):
```
make html
```
To make PDF (result in `_build/latex`, requires LaTeX):
```
make pdf
```
To make all:
```
make all
```
Finally, to make all and update webassembly.github.io/spec with it:
```
make publish
```
Please make sure to only use that once a change has approval.
