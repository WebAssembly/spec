.. index:: ! execution, stack, store

Conventions
-----------

WebAssembly code is *executed* when :ref:`instantiating <exec-instantiation>` a module or :ref:`invoking <exec-invocation>` an :ref:`exported <syntax-export>` function on the resulting module :ref:`instance <syntax-moduleinst>`.

Execution behavior is defined in terms of an *abstract machine* that models the *program state*.
It includes a *stack*, which records operand values and control constructs, and an abstract *store* containing global state.

For each instruction, there is a rule that specifies the effect of its execution on the program state.
Furthermore, there are rules describing the instantiation of a module.
As with :ref:`validation <validation>`, all rules are given in two *equivalent* forms:

1. In *prose*, describing the execution in intuitive form.
2. In *formal notation*, describing the rule in mathematical form. [#cite-pldi2017]_

.. note::
   As with validation, the prose and formal rules are equivalent,
   so that understanding of the formal notation is *not* required to read this specification.
   The formalism offers a more concise description in notation that is used widely in programming languages semantics and is readily amenable to mathematical proof.


.. _exec-notation-textual:

Prose Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execution is specified by stylised, step-wise rules for each :ref:`instruction <syntax-instr>` of the :ref:`abstract syntax <syntax>`.
The following conventions are adopted in stating these rules.

* The execution rules implicitly assume a given :ref:`store <store>` :math:`S`.

* The execution rules also assume the presence of an implicit :ref:`stack <stack>`
  that is modified by *pushing* or *popping*
  :ref:`values <syntax-value>`, :ref:`labels <syntax-label>`, and :ref:`frames <syntax-frame>`.

* Certain rules require the stack to contain at least one frame.
  The most recent frame is referred to as the *current* frame.

* Both the store and the current frame are mutated by *replacing* some of its components.
  Such replacement is assumed to apply globally.

* The execution of an instruction may *trap*,
  in which case the entire computation is aborted and no further modifications to the store are performed by it. (Other computations can still be initiated afterwards.)

* The execution of an instruction may also end in a *jump* to a designated target,
  which defines the next instruction to execute.

* Execution can *enter* and *exit* :ref:`instruction sequences <syntax-instr-seq>` that form :ref:`blocks <syntax-instr-control>`.

* :ref:`Instruction sequences <syntax-instr-seq>` are implicitly executed in order, unless a trap or jump occurs.

* In various places the rules contain *assertions* expressing crucial invariants about the program state.

Formal Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   This section gives a brief explanation of the notation for specifying execution formally.
   For the interested reader, a more thorough introduction can be found in respective text books. [#cite-tapl]_

The formal execution rules use a standard approach for specifying operational semantics, rendering them into *reduction rules*.
Every rule has the following general form:

.. math::
   \X{configuration} \quad\stepto\quad \X{configuration}

A *configuration* is a syntactic description of a program state.
Each rule specifies one *step* of execution.
As long as there is at most one reduction rule applicable to a given configuration, reduction -- and thereby execution -- is *deterministic*.
WebAssembly has only very few exceptions to this, which are noted explicitly in this specification.

For WebAssembly, a configuration typically is a tuple :math:`(S; F; \instr^\ast)` consisting of the current :ref:`store <store>` :math:`S`, the :ref:`call frame <frame>` :math:`F` of the current function, and the sequence of :ref:`instructions <syntax-instr>` that is to be executed.
(A more precise definition is given :ref:`later <syntax-config>`.)

To avoid unnecessary clutter, the store :math:`S` and the frame :math:`F` are omitted from reduction rules that do not touch them.

There is no separate representation of the :ref:`stack <stack>`.
Instead, it is conveniently represented as part of the configuration's instruction sequence.
In particular, :ref:`values <syntax-val>` are defined to coincide with |CONST| instructions,
and a sequence of |CONST| instructions can be interpreted as an operand "stack" that grows to the right.

.. note::
   For example, the :ref:`reduction rule <exec-binop>` for the :math:`\I32.\ADD` instruction can be given as follows:

   .. math::
      (\I32.\CONST~n_1)~(\I32.\CONST~n_2)~\I32.\ADD \quad\stepto\quad (\I32.\CONST~(n_1 + n_2) \mod 2^{32})

   Per this rule, two |CONST| instructions and the |ADD| instruction itself are removed from the instruction stream and replaced with one new |CONST| instruction.
   This can be interpreted as popping two value off the stack and pushing the result.

   When no result is produced, an instruction reduces to the empty sequence:

   .. math::
      \NOP \quad\stepto\quad \epsilon

:ref:`Labels <label>` and :ref:`frames <frame>` are similarly :ref:`defined <syntax-instr-admin>` to be part of an instruction sequence.

The order of reduction is determined by the definition of an appropriate :ref:`evaluation context <syntax-ctxt-eval>`.

Reduction *terminates* when no more reduction rules are applicable.
:ref:`Soundness <soundness>` of the WebAssembly :ref:`type system <type-system>` guarantees that this is only the case when the original instruction sequence has either been reduced to a sequence of |CONST| instructions, which can be interpreted as the :ref:`values <syntax-val>` of the resulting operand stack,
or if a :ref:`trap <syntax-trap>` occurred.

.. note::
   For example, the following instruction sequence,

   .. math::
      (\F64.\CONST~x_1)~(\F64.\CONST~x_2)~\F64.\NEG~(\F64.\CONST~x_3)~\F64.\ADD~\F64.\MUL

   terminates after three steps:

   .. math::
      \begin{array}{ll}
      & (\F64.\CONST~x_1)~(\F64.\CONST~x_2)~\F64.\NEG~(\F64.\CONST~x_3)~\F64.\ADD~\F64.\MUL \\
      \stepto & (\F64.\CONST~x_1)~(\F64.\CONST~x_4)~(\F64.\CONST~x_3)~\F64.\ADD~\F64.\MUL \\
      \stepto & (\F64.\CONST~x_1)~(\F64.\CONST~x_5)~\F64.\MUL \\
      \stepto & (\F64.\CONST~x_6) \\
      \end{array}

   where :math:`x_4 = -x_2` and :math:`x_5 = -x_2 + x_3` and :math:`x_6 = x_1 \cdot (-x_2 + x_3)`.
