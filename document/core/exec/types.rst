Types
-----

Execution has to check and compare :ref:`types <syntax-type>` in a few places, such as :ref:`executing <exec-call_indirect>` |CALLINDIRECT| or :ref:`instantiating <exec-instantiation>` :ref:`modules <syntax-module>`.

It is an invariant of the semantics that all types occurring during execution are :ref:`closed <type-closed>`.

.. note::
   Runtime type checks generally involve types from multiple modules or types not defined by a module at all, such that module-local :ref:`type indices <syntax-typeidx>` are not meaningful.

Instantiation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any form of :ref:`type <syntax-type>` can be *instantiated* into a :ref:`closed <type-closed>` type inside a :ref:`module instance <syntax-moduleinst>` by :ref:`substituting <notation-subst>` each :ref:`type index <syntax-typeidx>` :math:`x` occurring in it with the corresponding :ref:`defined type <syntax-deftype>` :math:`\moduleinst.\MITYPES[x]`.

.. math::
   \insttype_{\moduleinst}(t) = t[\subst \moduleinst.\MITYPES]
